manifest.json   <-- Required config file for Chrome
This is the “package.json” of extensions. For Chrome v3:
content_scripts = code injected into Instagram pages (where you’ll scrape followers/following).
action = popup that shows when the user clicks your extension.
content.js      <-- Runs inside Instagram’s page
popup.html      <-- Small popup UI when clicking the extension
This is like your Angular component but barebones HTML
popup.js        <-- Logic for the popup UI
